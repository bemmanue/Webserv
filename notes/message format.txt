All HTTP/1.1 messages consist of a start-line followed by a sequence
   of octets in a format similar to the Internet Message Format
   [RFC5322]: zero or more header fields (collectively referred to as
   the "headers" or the "header section"), an empty line indicating the
   end of the header section, and an optional message body.
     HTTP-message   = start-line
                      *( header-field CRLF )
                      CRLF
                      [ message-body ]

The normal procedure for parsing an HTTP message is to read the
    start-line into a structure, read each header field into a hash table
    by field name until the empty line, and then use the parsed data to
    determine if a message body is expected.  If a message body has been
    indicated, then it is read as a stream until an amount of octets
    equal to the message body length is read or the connection is closed.

A recipient MUST parse an HTTP message as a sequence of octets in an
    encoding that is a superset of US-ASCII [USASCII].  Parsing an HTTP
    message as a stream of Unicode characters, without regard for the
    specific encoding, creates security vulnerabilities due to the
    varying ways that string processing libraries handle invalid
    multibyte character sequences that contain the octet LF (%x0A).

A sender MUST NOT send whitespace between the start-line and the
   first header field.  A recipient that receives whitespace between the
   start-line and the first header field MUST either reject the message
   as invalid or consume each whitespace-preceded line without further
   processing of it (i.e., ignore the entire line, along with any
   subsequent lines preceded by whitespace, until a properly formed
   header field is received or the header section is terminated).

The first line of a response message is the status-line, consisting
    of the protocol version, a space (SP), the status code, another
    space, a possibly empty textual phrase describing the status code,
    and ending with CRLF.
